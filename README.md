> **Videogame Data Hub** provides in-PeerTube Wikidata-based tagging of videos for depicted video games and features to improve discoverability of gaming videos and viewer engagement. It is based on an idea from [PeerTube#352](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/issues/352) and will serve as a proof of concept for a broader Wikidata integration inside PeerTube.

## Description

**Videogame Data Hub** aims to complete two goals:
1. Provide a working proof of concept of Wikidata integration into PeerTube, especially for multilingual tags (see [PeerTube#352](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/issues/352)).
2. Improve the user experience for both content creators and viewers of videogame-related videos through linked-data enriched tagging of videos.

In the meantime, you can explore the work of [Wikidata's Video Games Task Force](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Video_games), a team of contributors passionate about video games and dedicated to improving Wikidata's coverage about this topic. One of their broader goal is to turn Wikidata into "the universal glue of the Internet", "the Internet duct tape" or, as others have called it, "The New Rosetta Stone" ([source](https://lab.cccb.org/en/wikidata-the-new-rosetta-stone/)) or even "the underground fungus in the vast forest that is the Internet" :

> I believe Wikidata can be the underground fungus in the vast forest that is the Internet. With every identifier we cross-link, we are weaving this underground network, and in time we will allow these databases, even of different “species”, to talk to each other and exchange information and data. A true ecosystem. ([Jean-Frédéric](https://commonists.wordpress.com/2019/10/10/my-message-to-video-game-databases-wekidata-come-in-peace/))

Thanks to Wikidata, **Videogame Data Hub** will allow :
* content creators to automatically provide partner links to video games stores (GOG, Humble Store, Epic Games Store, etc.)
* viewers to learn more about the game they are watching, with data coming from HowLongToBeat, speedrun.com, etc.

## Overview

**Videogame Data Hub** is still under heavy development. Get in touch with @Poslovitch if you are looking for additional information. You can follow the development process on [projects.poslovitch.fr/vgdh](https://projects.poslovitch.fr/vgdh).
